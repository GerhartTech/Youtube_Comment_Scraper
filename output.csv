"Thanks for the story, I’ve got the spark back."
"VIDEO IDEA
Hey David, really good video. One thing that you could also focus on and that seems to be popular on the net among conspiracy theorists is how the elite and ruling class is going to use AI. It would be really cool if you could do a video on that. Technology is a tool that always ends up in hands of people who rule our societies. Already subscribed ;)"
he is not 19 year old
Dude your story telling skills are good
nice video.. really engaging
Lmao sam Altman is a man that taught giga bytes how to think big deal math is thinking so where is AGI........ I'LL WAIT BUT I ONLY GOT LIKE 40 GOOD YEARS LEFT ON THIS PLANET
❤🎉 JOHNNY JOHANSEN NO-WAY og takk til dere som ikke har fått med seg selv som har ikke fått med deg om jobb som jeg ikke får.
The public will judge this video.
he going to get himself killed
"'we can eliminate poverty' - just recently looking at china, replacing delivery drivers and low income low skillset jobs with ai driven robots and models. We have the ability to eliminate poverty, but only if we do it right, and greedy humans will not do it right, i can tell u that much already."
naah naah ....19 yrs old ?!!!! dont joke 😒
The Mark Zuckerberg of this time.
"His words reminded me of the movie ""Don't look up"", where a crazy CEO promised to end world hunger and then ended up blowing the whole planet. AI research and advancement should be open to public for scrutiny and review. This shall not be proprietry to any company."
Aggressive  CEO....hmmm...why do I see jail in his future?
You somehow neglected to mention that he's gay. Also not sure what country you're in but it is illegal in many countries to ask for age of a job applicant.
"Ask chatgpt to read you the:
1. constitution
2. Bill of rights
3. Articles of the constitution"
"Listen, i know you got your motivation to make yotube videos from hustlers university. And listen again, i know you saw videos from the past that made it big and people made elon musk videos that got big because he wasnt so big at the time. 


This altman guy isn't that."
ChatGPT is just a small footnote in history. The real AI is yet to come.
"Thanks for the video, David, I leant a lot from the video about Sam Altman. One thing I wondered was when you used the '10X' and 100X as TEN EX and HUNDRED EX, I think you meant TEN TIMES and HUNDRED TIMES. I could be wrong. As English is not my first language, I am not great at correcting others. But over all, good job."
Andrej! Calm down with this thick Bulgarian accent!!
He's just good leader who helped get the investment to build chat gpt
"""the best people are so much better than the pretty good people"""
stop saying stupid things on the internet..he is no king of AI
Its just ALGORITHM intelligence.....not Artificial intelligence. Call it what it really is.
"I suppose the real reason because he had a good education and a hard-working mindset, but the ""great leader"" is just a result"
He’s 38!
Will become a destroyer of humans?
"smooth brain take. AI started like 50 years ago, thousands of research papers brought us to this point. If anything huggingface is the king of AI"
"1st you say, Sam is 19 years old, and then you said ""he was born in 1985"" Wtf?"
Smart marketer 😮
"Lol, you're a noob. The core team behind OpenAI does not include him; he was hired to become CEO to handle business 😂"
"It is childish to think that one person decides the future of humanity when social processes today are so developed and specialized that they do not occur through the action of a single person, or even a group of people. Let's think about Bitcoin, a technology that well portrays this systemic process that is impossible to stop even by the most powerful country in the world."
even his name is ALT man😂
Misinformation. Elon Musk came up with the name Open AI. It was supposed to be open source. Ilya Sutskever created the program. Sam was asked to run the company. It was a joint project. Elon was a board member and then left when the company started going the opposite direction.
"let's see in 5 years who is the king of AI, I doubt it will be him"
🙏
only work for AI is not a king
Crazy plan
I’m opportuned to have guidance and supervision from some of Wall Street’s eyes and ears. This is an exciting time of year after a tough one all round. I made a significant profit with my MSFT holdings recently and have drawn almost 100k for the holidays.
Exaggerated claims.
"I’m not sure you researched the history of AI much. The “AI winter” was over with the Google and later DeepMind investment. For an example, how much do you think it costs to design a chip? Do you know who made tensorflow? And when did they start advertising selling TPUs as k part of their cloud services? What was the timeframe for this?"
I dislike when people become intrigued by quotables. Be careful.
He has no weight and no tech knowledge.
"""man"""
"Why it's recommended to me, after Sam got fired!!"
hes 38
The Man Who Owns Silicon Valley...was just fired
"It's strange how this guy went from a nobody to a household name in like a month last year. Even Elon Musk took awhile to become widely known. It's indicative of the insane rate of AI progress, which is both exciting and alarming. 

We're not ready. But on the other hand, we have some really hard problems that need solving. Pretty sure the human race's endgame isn't a bunch of people in nursing homes shitting themselves in diapers."
"Larry Page, Elon Musk, Zuckerburg owns Silicone Valley"
"it can create everything instantly but
it can also destroy everything instantly :)"

"11:9 It's just promoting it for Sam Outman, he's totally lying.❤"
"Great Learning, Thanks David for this excellent efforts"
Thanks for your sharing. I like it.
He is a genius
How can AI eliminate poverty ? I didn’t get this!
Sam Altman has great potential and can rule the world in terms of AI.
"he is not 19 years old ,he is actually 38 years old what kind of research you are doing before providing information//??😑😑"
Only information Workers jobs are threatened by AI. computer programmers etc..
"AI super GENIOUS is Demis Hassabis earn 3 PhDs from Harvard, MIT and Cambridge (UK's MIT) IQ 210... founder of DeepMind."
How does or can a MACHINE cuss at an intelligent human being as such?
"Give some space and money to Sam, He will solve real problems mean real problems .. Encourage real people that solves problems in the world like Sam altman"
Great info
All fine but what happen of the two friends which dropped out because of Sam Altman 😅??
I think you are kid of jawed Kareem
"good video ideas, but u have communication problems!!!!!!"
4:41literal egg head
WORLDCOIN
Really great video! I think Sam is going to becoming increasingly more popular and talked about in the next 5 years.
"This is Nonsense AI . can he tell anything about dark energy or dark matter, where we should focus now ..."
i hope all the naive people watching this understand what a shill is
these israelis are out of control
would love to catch him in a back alley on a dark night
“The best people are so much better than the pretty good people” - This is so true.
nothing last forever
Great video man.. Keep up this awesome work.
aw hell naw this guy last name legit says he is just a ALT MAN wonder what his main is >.>
Chatgpt is failed to pass JEE entrance exam and UPSC entrance exam which held in India
He is 38 years old 🤣😂😅
He's a good guy whose genius is being exploited in exchange of virtual tag of ceo and co-founder. He's just got his good days going on
I think I don’t have future since i am graduated not drop out.
It’s similar to Jesus who hated the organized religion at the time so he tried to stop him but was betrayed by Judas. Now he is the figure head for a religion tha practiced the same acts he tried to stopped
Why should people clickbate you to watch their channel
19? he looks 30
who's money with he built it? so the owner of AI is the One who gave that millions or the millions of open source contributors ??
@6:38 saw my teacher Andrew NG
"The guys saying that GPT-4 is smarter than a doctor is just embarrassingly stupid. No shit. If you want a real comparison, give all the doctors access to the internet throughout the test. I can't believe people genuinely think chat-gpt is gonna take their jobs..."
Youhh screamHHH so algoRYYTHMMM wiLL looovfeee YOU!!! <3 Thanks for this material ;)
is he only 19 years old? Is it correct info?
"If you don't understand how SV CEO's are front puppets, you are not digging deep enough. Do you really think Elon Musk both makes cars, batteries, solar panels, rockets, robots, AI, etc, etc? Do you think Elon Musk has super human abilities, or do you think there is a huge team behind him and he is hired to be the front figure for public image?"
"Everytime there is noise. Once it was IoT boom, then 5G now Ai. Just combination of politics & economy, US knows they have Google, Microrsoft etc with huge database of users hence Ai is new tool to control economy"
Elon and Sam are great
"No way 
YOU Don't realities  Where is  Al"
A person born 1985 and he is 19yrs 😂😂😂
if he was born in 1985 how can he be 19? bro I think you are very bad in Mathematics ..least recommended channel
"I also think that another reason for why chatgpt took off so quickly was because of how bad google's search engine has become. I dont want ads, i dont want to scroll through infinite links. All i really want is an answer to my question/problem. Most of the time I can get exactly what i need from chatgpt rather than having to go through link after link putting little pieces together."
"'AI' is Pure Superstition, and Illiteracy,
Intelligence can Never be 'artificial'."
You are doing great jop David keep doing it .
why are you aggressively narrating this ?? if it is for holding attention and keeping people hooked its not working try to be yourself it will be better
well done. good video.
Dude just made the skynet for real bro
"those who dont know all other ai is using customized version of chatgpt , for ex midjouney too"
thanos
"He is only 19 years old. 
He was born in 1985. 

Mmh 🤐😂the math ain't mathing"
"I am better. I could beat him anytime, anywhere."
"If he can convinced friends to dropout, then he can convinced the world 😂"
"5 minutes in and this seems like a puff piece. Im not saying it is, but im not all that impressed with the guy. And no he doesn't own Sillicon Valley, the clickbait title is what probably made me feel disappointed by this thing."
"13:47, credits is @Corridor (New Robot Makes Soldiers Obsolete (Corridor Digital))"
"Sam is nothing but an agent of the state,, like Gates, Bezos, Musk, etc. Don't be fooled by yet another disney story"
We would love to hear from others about their thoughts on the influence of individuals like Sam Altman and the responsibilities that come with such power. How can we ensure that AI development remains ethical and inclusive? What are your perspectives on the future of AI and its impact on society?
"DALL-E best suits for schools , which brings kids imagination to reality and they can sense that and see their vision with their eyes. They should create some programs through this Dall-E AI especially for elementary and middle schoolers. Endless possibilities with practical touch. In fact its simulation of end production of what human just thinks in mind."
Why most of the successful persons are school/college dropped outs  🤣🤣🤣🤣
"U have my vote or just subscription xD From accent I hear u are from my sides. Best regards from Poland, bro!"
Aha the man behind skynet.

Sam has the will of the 'D'. Sam D. Altman.
he is 38 years old not 19
"how the f is some one born in 1985 is currently 19years old,,,"
"Andrej karpathy > Sam Altman. 

Sure he is the CEO of OpenAI. Made huge deal with Microsoft and rolled out ChatGPT to the world. That's huge achievement. But not the ""king"" of AI. Deepmind""s Demis could be other person and lot of people who have contributed to AI/ML/DL.  Also, isn't Transformers the T in GPT came out of Google?(I could be wrong.)"
Feels like a psychopath
It's just a silly con.
Sometimes you discovered something you shouldn't have or regret even know it AI.
"People don't realize that this new idol with his team taught AI to lie – one of the sins which come as an armageddon in near future. If you have a baby teach good things, not sins."
He built it. But the idea is from Bill Gates.
Satanic idea... Damage human race
he is not the founder of OpenAI
spoiler: sam bought this guy david ondrej 😅
"Fantastic passion in Sam Altman.
100books a year, he reads"
"I liked the video, i beleive AI is like human building its own god sort of speak, someone to look for answers. scary."
"how the f is he 19 since 1985 
for now he should be at 27-28"
Good job David... where did you get all this info... I bet from AI as well.
"Yeah man, just say that he is a genius... better, Jesus Christ itself. I still dont get it how people who consume this types of videos do not get sick of it."
"Okay but with a name like ALTman, Alternative man, AI... Gates, Jobs, Musk... it kinda fits."
His cousin is my classmate
elon musk made Atlman a king lets not forget that fact!!!!!!!!!!!!!
great video bro
"Saw him few years ago getting video game recommendation from Elon musk , shocked and proud to see what this man become."
if you want to get rich with startups be ajew
"He  holds investments in over 400 companies, and still trying to get monetized on Google. lol"
Awesome
"Wonder who pays you but you are clearly spreading propaganda, technology is not there to cure any diseases,  it causes them. It will cause suffering and destroy the environment. And nobody convinces Microsoft of anything,  where the money is the decisions are made, not he other way around...

"You presented an amazing video and I was very impressed by your insights and knowledge. You explained the history and vision of OpenAI very clearly and engagingly, and you highlighted some of the amazing achievements and challenges of this field. I learned a lot from your video and I appreciate your passion and enthusiasm for AI. Thank you for sharing your expertise and perspective with us. I rewarded to like it and subscribe... keep it up David"
"One has to be careful of what they consume on the internet. Imagine calling Sam Altman the owner of Silicon Valley when all he did was getting involved in LLMs. Swears most people that make videos about AI don't even know the difference between GPT, LLMs and AI."
Reported for misrepresentation and misinformation. Do better.
MK Ultra...
What stood out most is his mentality as a Doomsday Prepper

Good reserch :)

nice video man
HE IS THE GODD
"Sam is not relly a ""dropout"" he is a ""overly motivated driven"" driven person that is confident enought / motivated enought to drop out and work on stuff. Biological lottery or smth else. I felt like that before and it is awesome to feel like that (obviously speculating dont know how he feels or continues to feel)"
This is the second time i saw a good video of you i think. maybe i subscribe soon.
"good video seems researched pretty well (not saiyng its accurate going based of intuition, sam is awesome he thinks like me, im actually not sure if he saw and followed the plan i gave him ~7 years ago on a y-combinator video. But even if he did recognizing something and following it as he did is 100% intelligence. Great person especially the character and philantropic stuff and the things he is interessted in. Would make a great freind if he has even a barely good character in private. One of my heroes or role models (love his motivation that spirit is amazing) also seems to be kind maybe a bit overworryed about AI and if its true that he raced cars and jets for years after money then im not so sure i would have done the same but (i would have tried i guess if i had not much to do not the jets but the car maybe....... not so into that stuff i would be more of a a good food/restaurants and building AI and cool inventions / debates / youtube channel philsiiophy / philantropy / team of people to work on stuff/ political stuff/ databases to help people that want to do the same suff as me/  better evaluaton of good/bad thigns to focus on automating and making public so not everyone has to reenvent the weel: kinda potential millionaire (but in reality im a person who tries to adhd medicate himself but its super slow and i lack motivation but got all the ideas + 10000x litterally i got all the ideas you can have. name a topic or problem i will have a idea like chatGPT just way less but in my opinion actually effective stuff. 

Ive seen that for everything i said that turned out to be great later and barely anything that did not work (altho of course if smth is not done then cant know that)"
"just because there was a scam that used the mantle or said anythign he had to to do smth does not mean ""effective altruism"" is a meme now....... it definitly is needed more than ever.

Also not saying that person (did not look into it)  did not have any good intentions maybe they just did not realize something and then got caught up and had no way out. who knows. but even if totally terrible clear 100% scam then that does not make effective altruism bad, just as a horrific person drinking water does not make water bad"
You get awarded for making this video ...  thanks ❤
"Really N****, ""Sam Altman is only 19 years old"" then ""born in 1985"" ...this video is just a month old. Really N****"

If you want to talk about an AI king, Demis Hassabis is closer… he is in another league."
"AI is going to be the end of us...These idiots need to stop. Just imagine what an evil version of gpt 4 is capable of. Imagine if the military had access (pretty sure they already do though) to this technology. Korea, China, Some talibans over in Irak that are hellbent on destroying the U.S. Who would stop them? The government with their regulations? Get real...The more people adopt AI the more the chances increase for global war and that is a hard truth that these higher-ups need to accept and act on IMMEDIATELY"

Shame this guy doesn't get recognition until chatgpt I only knew him when Elon musk funded Open AI before open ai was a nonprofit org
"what a joke, chatgpt won't be what it is now without research papers from google (which are open to the public), bard is now much better since it is near real time"

They betrayed Elon Musk
What's next?

well detailed
"Thanks for the awesome content, David! Keep up the great work!

"""with his work ethic and intelligence he got himself into Stamford""... Nothing at all to do with being from a very wealthy family who were able to send him to a ""prestigious private school""."
"Stop these non-sense. Everybody has their specific AI models for specific tasks. He didn't even own single penny in Open AI. Open AI is owned and trained by Microsoft and has the highest equity, not Sam Altman.  Be educated"
"Great video, thanks"
It’s crazy how all these tech guys have the same story 😅
Prestigious private school... Broke college student?
This man's vision is destroying Millions of jobs and giant corporations are supporting it. The government is sleeping. There will be a Chaos.
Hmm well lets see them cure disease before bragging about it. We have seen lots of people brag about their inventions before and where are they now? Silly to do that as it then looks like a scam when they can't do it.
He's 19yo and he was born in 1985 woa. What a champ

Sam was joint founder with Elon Musk
Altman was broke? At what moment in his life he was broke?
"8:04 Elon early contributor of open AI
8:43 met with Satia Nadela"
😮😮😮😮
"I believe he is surely a great guy. But if you were born in highly educated family, you have time and resources, there are not many goals, you want to aim for.

maybe rename it to closedAI now
"I just subscribed you, bcoz you you speak English so clearly"
Nice Video
"My understanding is Musk had concerns about the potential for misuses of this technology - hence the parting of ways.  With speculation growing about how soon AI might consider humanity obsolete, or just a menace, it's Interesting to note Altman is a prepper with his own bunker.  I think I must have misheard and Sam isn't his first name - it's Jack - as in ... 'I'm alright, Jack'!  😂"
"clickbait title, he doesn't own SV"
He is basically reading wikipedia page of Sam Altman.
"Will he be remembered as a the jesus of the internet or will he be the Miles Dyson of the real world? I'll check back in at the 5 and 10 years mark to see how it's lookin!!! 

Remember at 1 point there were very few guns in the world. Now we're swimming in guns and gun violence as a result of them being everywhere.  Right now A.I. is basically putting a really big gun with infinity ammo in the hands of everyone we wouldn't trust with a pellet gun...  A.I. has the potential to save humanity but humanity will use A.I. to destroy humanity...( greed will lead the way so say goodbye to you jobs.

solid video here thanks for making it very creative and nice storytelling skills great work!
He doesn't own silicon valley. He doesn't even own any part of OpenAI. He's more like the figurehead of AI - he didn't even build it.
great video informative to make your videos more engageable and enjoyable would be to change the background view . then it would be very good
"0:50 take it easy, man )"
Amazing
"so good ,i like your content,can you share the videos making process"
Which software you use for recording and editing?
Your channel is one of the best sources for CHATGPT and AI
Good video but there are some details missing. OpenAI has more investors who pledged a $1B which includes Peter Thiel and Reid Hoffman. Elon backed off because he didn't get his demand of being the CEO of OpenAI fulfilled. Running a GPT is a very very cost-intensive thing hence they partnered with Microsoft to a capped profit model.
We are born in the same year but he is still 19 yrs old...that is amazing
Another Jew from Poland? Will ruin internet just like Susan Wójcicki from Google?
